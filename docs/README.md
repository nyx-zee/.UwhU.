# How to ~~o~~Wormhole

The [Domain of Pochven][1] is finally anchored and realized just as Zowya wanted, but the Convocation of Triglav feels that normal stargates are rather pass√© and so had them [jammed full of rakovene to shut them off][6].

In the absence of an abundant supply of ['Krai' and 'Pochven' filaments][2], we're left to Prove ourselves in the navigation of wormhole space if we wish to move between New Eden and Pochven, as wormholes are the only other means of entry into Triglavian space.

Herein I will describe the basic skills necessary to get from [K-space][4], to [J-space][5], to Triglavian space, and back again.

Wormhole space in general is a rather vast topic. There are over 2,600 star systems reachable only through wormholes which exhibit a wide range of weather effects, difficulty levels, or are otherwise entirely unique spaces. As such, I encourage you to seek out and utilize other [resources][3] on the subject where it falls outside of the narrow scope of successfully moving to and from Pochven.

# Getting Started

This guide is split to serve two different audiences.
### ***If you just want to get to Pochven and someone else has already found a path...***

then proceed to the **[Basic Guide to Getting There][13]**.
<br>

1. Familiarize yourself with the nature of [wormhole space][8] to understand the rules and risks.

   The following points are especially important:
   
   * Wormhole space is -1.0 security space.
   
     There is no CONCORD response or crimewatch.
   
     Weapons, modules, and anchorables such as bombs, heavy interdiction, and bubbles -- which are normally banned outside of nullsec -- can be used freely here.

   * Wormhole space has no local chat member list. You will only know others are present if they speak, appear on the directional scanner, or the same grid as you.

   * Wormhole connections evaporate and change constantly. There is no immutable map of Anoikis like in New Eden. At best a path can be guaranteed to be stable up to 4 hours, and even then other players can intentionally close connections with enough effort (or even by accident!).

     As such, it is possible that a route will be severed unexpectedly, preventing you from reaching Pochven or returning to New Eden until a new route is discovered.

     Should you become stranded, your options are:
     
     - Scan a new path to K-space on your own. This requires a probe launcher and probes -- consider including these on your travel fit, or at least in your cargo with a mobile depot.
     - Have someone else fish you out. This is very difficult given that there are 2,600 systems randomly changing their connections daily.
     - Utilize a needlejack filament to move yourself to null sec.
     - Die in combat or via self-destruct to wake up in a new clone at your home station.

   - When not in immediate danger, turn off afterburners and microwarpdrives and let the module cycle complete before jumping through wormholes.

2. Prepare your ship for travel.
 
     Consider including a probe launcher, probes, a mobile depot, and a needlejack filament in your cargohold.
   
   For ships with no cloak, consider temporarily fitting an afterburner (rather than a MWD) for the final burn up to the Triglavian wormhole.
   
   Two or three warp core stabilizers will help you to dodge the enemy NPCs on the other side of the last connection. Small ships with low HP may wish to fit for sub two-second align times instead.

3. Connect to the .UWU. wormhole bookmark folder.

4. Travel to the entry system and then follow the bookmarks. 

   Bookmarks marked with a " - " move you towards Pochven, and bookmarks marked with a " + "  move you towards New Eden.

   With default keybinds, pressing the 'L' key opens a small window that shows only bookmarks in your current system, which can be very helpful when traveling this way.

5. When you reach the final bookmark, you will see enormous chunks of rakovene in a tetrahedral pattern, oriented toward a wormhole. Triglavian NPCs guard this side of the connection, so a minor amount of positive standing with the Convocation is necessary (something like 0.01).

   These wormhole sites are similar to Drifter wormhole entrances in that they force a pilot to land toward a specific point, and do not allow warping within the site.

   (A more advanced discussion of landing close to the wormhole can be found [in this short article][11].)

   Approach the wormhole and enter it as quickly as possible. Other players may use the restrictive nature of the wormhole site to setup a trap.

6. Emerging into Pochven, you will likely be met by drifter and sleeper NPCs. As long as you have prepared accordingly with fast align, warp core stabilization, or a cloak trick, you should be able to align out and warp to safety.

   Welcome to the Domain of Pochven.
