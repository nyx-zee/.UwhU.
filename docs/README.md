# How to ~~o~~Wormhole

The [Domain of Pochven][1] is finally anchored and realized just as Zowya wanted, but the Convocation of Triglav feels that normal stargates are rather pass√© and so had them [jammed full of rakovene to shut them off][2].

In the absence of an abundant supply of ['Krai' and 'Pochven' filaments][3], we're left to Prove ourselves in the navigation of wormhole space if we wish to move between New Eden and Pochven, as wormholes are the only other means of entry into Triglavian space.

Herein I will describe the basic skills necessary to get from [K-space][4], to [J-space][5], to Triglavian space, and back again.

Wormhole space in general is a rather vast topic. There are over 2,600 star systems reachable only through wormholes which exhibit a wide range of weather effects, difficulty levels, or are otherwise entirely unique spaces. As such, I encourage you to seek out and utilize other [resources][6] on the subject where it falls outside of the narrow scope of successfully moving to and from Pochven.

# Getting Started

This guide is split to serve two different audiences. 

***If you just want to get to Pochven and someone else has already found a path...***

then proceed to the **[Basic Guide to Getting There][7]**.

***If you are interested in helping find new paths through Anoikis and learning to use Pathfinder...***

then proceed to **[.UwhU.'s Guide to Anoikis][8]**.
