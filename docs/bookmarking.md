# Bookmarking

Bookmarks are everything when it comes to exploring wormholes. They let us know where we've been and get others to where they're going. As such, a clean, standarized method of naming bookmarks is crucial.

Below is an example of a complete bookmark:

    ! + W UWU C6 J123456 [L]

A complete bookmark has six parts (four of which are conditional). 

These six parts are (from left to right):

1. An ' **!** ', but *only if* the wormhole is End of Life, or critically disrupted.

2. A ' **+** ' or ' **-** ', but *only if* the wormhole is the entrance or exit along the optimal path toward k-space (+), or the exit along the optimal path toward home in j-space (-).

3. A single letter describing the type of site:

   - **W** for wormholes
   - **C** for combat sites
   - **D** for data sites
   - **R** for relic sites
   - **G** for gas sites

4. Two letters describing the type of space on the other side of the connection (*only if* the bookmark marks a wormhole):

   - **C1**, **C2**, ... **C6**, or **C13** for J-space destinations
   - **HS** for high security system destinations
   - **LS** for low security system destinations
   - **NS** for null security system destinations
   - **TS** for Triglavian space system destinations

5. The J-number or proper name of the destination system (*only if* the bookmark marks a wormhole).

6. A letter, in square brackets, describing the largest size ship that may pass through the connection (*only if* the bookmark marks a wormhole):

   - **S** if the 'Show Info' includes, *"Only the smallest ships can pass through this wormhole"*.
   - **M** if the 'Show Info' includes, *"Up to medium size ships can pass through this wormhole"*.
   - **L** if the 'Show Info' includes, *"Larger ships can pass through this wormhole"*.
   - **XL** if the 'Show Info' includes, *"Very large ships can pass through this wormhole"*.
